## 1. Overview

This document details the design and implementation roadmap for the domain expert systems and broader ecosystem extensions of the Cortex platform. In our architecture, the Cortex Core connects to various specialized domain expert systems via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). These expert systems (such as Code Assistant, Deep Research, and Autodesk Fusion Expert) are designed to provide advanced, domain-specific intelligence and can be easily hot-swapped with community or third-party solutions. Additionally, this document covers future enhancements like the "Workspaces" concept to organize projects and contextual artifacts.

## 2. Domain Expert Systems

Domain expert systems are specialized modules that offload high-complexity tasks from the Cortex Core. They enable the system to leverage domain-specific intelligence without exposing the core system to the intricacies of each area. Examples include:

- **Code Assistant**: Focused on coding tasks such as project structure analysis, code generation, and refactoring. Integrates with development environments (e.g., via a VS Code Extension) through MCP.

- **Deep Research**: Handles extensive information retrieval, knowledge synthesis, and summarization tasks. It can validate sources and provide detailed research support.

- **Autodesk Fusion Expert**: A conceptual module that abstracts the complexity of interacting with the Autodesk Fusion API, enabling high-level 3D model directives without requiring deep knowledge of Fusionâ€™s API details.

These systems are connected via MCP, which standardizes communication and permits seamless replacement or augmentation with third-party offerings.

## 3. External Integration and Tools

In addition to domain experts, the Cortex platform integrates with various external tools and services, including:

- **VS Code Extension (MCP Server)**: Provides direct integration with VS Code, enabling context-aware code assistance.
- **M365 Apps**: Connects to Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel for document and presentation management.
- **Browser Extension (Playwright)**: Facilitates web automation and interaction with browser-based applications.
- **Other Tools**: Custom connectors, API plugins, and specialized integration modules that enhance the platform's capabilities.

These integrations leverage MCP to maintain a uniform communication channel, allowing the Cortex Core to treat all connected modules as interchangeable components.

## 4. Workspaces Concept

The concept of **Workspaces** is included as a near-term initiative to provide a higher-level organizational structure. Workspaces are designed to group artifacts, conversations, and context by project, topic, or collaborative group. Key features include:

- **Artifact Organization**: Consolidate files, notes, and context within a defined workspace.
- **Contextual Integrity**: Maintain relevant conversation history and synthesized context specific to the workspace, rather than a raw transaction log.
- **Collaboration**: Allow multiple users to work within the same workspace environment, sharing expert inputs and insights as needed.

Workspaces are intended to be integrated with the core functionality, offering a contextual layer to support adaptive outputs and expert system interactions.

## 5. Implementation Roadmap

The following roadmap outlines our phased approach towards a comprehensive Cortex ecosystem that includes domain expert systems and workspace integration.

### 5.1 Immediate Actions (Phase 1: Foundation)

- **Domain Expert Integration:**
  - Connect initial domain experts (e.g., Code Assistant and Deep Research) to the Cortex Core using MCP.
  - Establish a common API interface for expert systems through the MCP Protocol.

- **Basic UI for Expert Interaction:**
  - Develop minimal interfaces (e.g., within a VS Code extension and a web dashboard) to test expert system outputs.

- **Initial Workspaces Setup:**
  - Prototype a simple workspace framework to group context and artifacts.

### 5.2 Core Capabilities and Expansion (Phase 2: Core Capabilities)

- **Enhance Domain Expert Systems:**
  - Improve the intelligence and contextual capabilities of Code Assistant and Deep Research.
  - Begin exploration of alternative/external expert systems, allowing hot-swapping of modules.

- **Refine MCP Integration:**
  - Ensure robust, standardized communication between the Cortex Core and expert systems.
  - Add error handling, logging, and dynamic discovery of MCP-enabled domain experts.

- **UI and Adaptive Output Enhancement:**
  - Further develop dashboard visualizations and integrate adaptive output strategies based on user modality (e.g., blending verbal and visual responses).

### 5.3 Long-Term Vision (Phase 3: Expansion & Refinement)

- **Advanced Workspaces:**
  - Improve workspace capabilities to include detailed project management, multi-user collaboration, and contextual filtering of artifacts.

- **Expanded Ecosystem of Domain Experts:**
  - Open the platform for third-party and community-driven domain expert systems.
  - Develop a marketplace or selection mechanism for expert systems based on performance and user preference.

- **Distributed and Federated Deployment:**
  - Support hybrid deployment models (cloud, edge, local) to scale the Cortex system across diverse environments.
  - Enhance security, permissions, and performance metrics for enterprise applications.

## 6. Technology Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) for core services and MCP integration.
- **MCP Integration:** Python MCP SDK for standardized client-server communication.
- **Domain Expert Systems:** Implemented in Python or TypeScript, depending on target integration requirements (e.g., Code Assistant via VS Code Extension).
- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript and Vite, utilizing Fluent Design for modern UI components.
- **Workspace Management:** Modular components using a combination of REST APIs and MCP messaging to group and contextualize work.

## 7. Conclusion

This document provides the strategic direction for integrating domain expert systems into the Cortex platform and outlines a roadmap for future enhancements. By leveraging MCP as a standard connectivity protocol, the system ensures flexibility and interoperability. The modular design allows for a vibrant ecosystem where default expert systems can be easily replaced or extended by community or third-party solutions.

Our next steps involve solidifying these designs in a proof-of-concept, refining the workspace model, and continuously integrating feedback from early adopters and contributors.
