# Cortex Core Implementation Progress

## Current Status

We have implemented the core components for the Cortex platform according to the implementation plan:

1. **Event System** - A topic-based publish/subscribe system for loosely coupled component communication
2. **I/O Manager** - Input/Output management with separate input receivers and output publishers
3. **Memory Manager** - Context management for conversations with caching capabilities
4. **Message Router** - Queue-based message processing with priority
5. **SSE Manager** - Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
6. **MCP Client** - Client for the Model Context Protocol to interact with domain experts

All components follow the project's "Ruthless Simplicity" philosophy, with minimal abstractions and direct, focused implementations.

## Type Checking and Linting

We've fixed the most critical type checking and linting issues, particularly:

1. Fixed signature of SSE endpoint parameters
2. Added proper type annotations to components
3. Fixed import issues in component `__init__.py` files
4. Added stubs for missing types for the logger module
5. Improved MCP client methods to handle None cases properly

However, there are still some issues to resolve, particularly in the API layers and services.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Remaining Type Issues**:
   - Resolve the missing `get_user_service` function in auth.py
   - Fix UUID conversion issues in API endpoints
   - Resolve domain model import/usage issues

2. **Create Tests**:
   - Write unit tests for each component
   - Create integration tests for the complete flow
   - Add boundary validation tests to ensure architectural integrity

3. **Connect Components**:
   - Implement concrete input receivers and output publishers
   - Create message handlers for the router
   - Connect router to domain experts via MCP

4. **API Implementation**:
   - Complete REST API endpoints for the SSE connection system
   - Add authentication and authorization to all endpoints
   - Ensure proper error handling

5. **Documentation**:
   - Add API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
   - Document component interactions
   - Create usage examples

6. **LLM Integration**:
   - Implement LLM service integration
   - Connect memory system to LLM for context management
   - Add domain expert integration

## Implementation Approach

The current implementation follows the phased approach outlined in the implementation plan:

1. **Phase 1** ✅ - Core components implementation
2. **Phase 2** ⏳ - Connect components, create concrete implementations of input/output channels
3. **Phase 3** ❌ - Domain expert framework and LLM integration
4. **Phase 4** ❌ - Advanced features and optimization

Focus on completing Phase 2 by creating concrete implementations of input/output channels and connecting the components in a working flow before moving to Phase 3.
