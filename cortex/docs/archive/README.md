# Cortex Platform Documentation

## Overview

The Cortex Platform is a next-generation AI assistant architecture designed to provide a unified intelligence experience across diverse interaction modalities and specialized domains. This documentation set explains the platform's architecture, components, and implementation guidelines.

## Core Concepts

The Cortex Platform is built on the following foundational principles:

- **Unified Intelligence**: A consistent AI experience regardless of entry point or modality
- **Context Preservation**: Maintaining understanding across interactions and time
- **Deep Domain Expertise**: Specialized capabilities through autonomous domain experts
- **Multi-Modal Interaction**: Seamless experience across diverse input and output channels
- **Tool Integration**: Connection with external tools and environments where users work
