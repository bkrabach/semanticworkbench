# Cortex Platform: Security and Privacy by Design

_Version: 1.0_  
_Date: 2025-03-04_

## Introduction

This document outlines the security and privacy architecture of the Cortex Platform. Security and privacy are not merely features but foundational principles embedded throughout the platform's design, development, and operation. As an AI platform that spans multiple contexts and accesses diverse data sources, Cortex's approach to security and privacy must be comprehensive, adaptable, and proactive.

The Cortex security and privacy architecture follows the principle of "Security and Privacy by Design," ensuring that these considerations are built into the system architecture from the beginning rather than added as afterthoughts. This approach is essential for establishing and maintaining user trust in a system that serves as a unified intelligence layer across digital experiences.

## Security and Privacy Principles

The Cortex Platform is built on the following core security and privacy principles:

### 1. Defense in Depth

Multiple security layers provide redundant protection so that the compromise of a single control does not expose the entire system.

### 2. Least Privilege

All components, users, and processes operate with the minimum permissions necessary to perform their functions and for the minimum time required.

### 3. Zero Trust Architecture

No entity is inherently trusted; verification is required regardless of location or network, with continuous validation throughout interactions.

### 4. Privacy by Default

The system assumes the most privacy-protective settings by default, requiring explicit actions to reduce privacy protections.

### 5. Data Minimization

Only the minimum necessary data is collected, processed, and retained to fulfill the specified purpose.

### 6. Transparency and Control

Users have clear visibility into what data is collected and how it is used, with meaningful controls over their information.

### 7. Secure by Design

Security is integrated into the development process from requirements through deployment and maintenance.

### 8. Continuous Validation

Regular testing, monitoring, and improvement ensure that security and privacy controls remain effective against evolving threats.
