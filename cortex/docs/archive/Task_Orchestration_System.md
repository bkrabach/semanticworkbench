# Cortex Task Orchestration System

_Version: 1.0_  
_Date: March 5, 2025_

## Overview

The Task Orchestration System is a core component of the Cortex Platform that manages the planning, decomposition, delegation, and execution of complex tasks. It serves as the operational backbone of the platform, coordinating work across domain experts, tools, and services to fulfill user requests efficiently and effectively.

## Core Concepts

### Task Model

The Task Orchestration System is built around these fundamental concepts:

1. **Tasks**: Discrete units of work with clear objectives and requirements
2. **Task Graphs**: Hierarchical structures representing task decomposition and dependencies
3. **Executors**: Components responsible for carrying out specific types of tasks
4. **Resources**: Assets, information, and capabilities required for task execution
5. **Contexts**: Execution environments including state, permissions, and constraints

### Task Types

The system supports multiple task types:

1. **Atomic Tasks**: Indivisible units of work executed by a single component
2. **Composite Tasks**: Complex tasks that require decomposition
3. **Sequential Tasks**: Tasks that must be executed in a specific order
4. **Parallel Tasks**: Tasks that can be executed simultaneously
5. **Conditional Tasks**: Tasks whose execution depends on specific conditions
6. **Iterative Tasks**: Tasks that require repeated execution with variations
7. **Long-Running Tasks**: Tasks that execute over extended periods
