# Cortex Platform: Ecosystem Strategy

_Version: 1.0_  
_Date: 2025-03-04_

## Introduction

The Cortex Platform is designed as more than just a productâ€”it's the foundation for a vibrant ecosystem of developers, partners, domain experts, and users. This ecosystem strategy outlines how Cortex will cultivate this community, establish value exchange mechanisms, and create a self-sustaining environment for continuous innovation.

The ecosystem approach is central to Cortex's vision of a unified intelligence layer that spans diverse digital contexts. By harnessing the collective creativity and expertise of a broad community, Cortex can expand its capabilities far beyond what any single organization could develop independently.
