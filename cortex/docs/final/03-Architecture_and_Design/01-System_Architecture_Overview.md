### Architectural Overview

At the center of the Cortex architecture is the **Central AI Core**, which coordinates all platform capabilities while maintaining a unified context and consistent user experience. This core orchestrates interactions between the memory system, cognition functions, domain experts, I/O modalities, and external integrations.

The architecture utilizes the **MCP (Memory, Cognition, and Perception) Protocol** as its integration standard, providing a consistent framework for connecting components and external tools. This protocol-driven approach enables the modular, extensible nature of the system while maintaining coherence.

## Data Flows

### Primary Interaction Flow

1. User input is received through an input modality
2. Input is processed and routed to the Central AI Core
3. Core consults memory system for relevant context
4. Cognition system reasons about the input and context
5. Tasks may be delegated to domain experts or external tools
6. Results are synthesized and formatted for output
7. Appropriate output modality is selected and used
8. Interaction is recorded in memory for future context

5. Results are returned to the requesting component
6. Results are processed and incorporated into response
7. Tool usage is recorded in memory
