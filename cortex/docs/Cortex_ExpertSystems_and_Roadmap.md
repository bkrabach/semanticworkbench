## 1. Overview

This document details the design and implementation roadmap for the domain expert systems and broader ecosystem extensions of the Cortex platform. In our architecture, the Cortex Core connects to various specialized domain expert systems via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). These expert systems (such as Code Assistant, Deep Research, and Autodesk Fusion Expert) are designed to provide advanced, domain-specific intelligence and can be easily hot-swapped with community or third-party alternatives. Additionally, this document covers future enhancements like the "Workspaces" concept to organize projects and contextual artifacts.

## 2. Domain Expert Systems

Domain expert systems are specialized modules that offload high-complexity tasks from the Cortex Core. They enable the system to leverage domain-specific intelligence without exposing the core system to the intricacies of each area. Example modules include:

- **Code Assistant**: Focused on coding tasks such as project structure analysis, code generation, and refactoring. Integrates with development environments (e.g., via a VS Code Extension) through MCP.

- **Deep Research**: Handles extensive information retrieval, knowledge synthesis, and summarization tasks. It can validate sources and provide detailed research support.

- **Autodesk Fusion Expert**: A conceptual module that abstracts the complexity of interacting with the Autodesk Fusion API, enabling high-level 3D model directives without requiring deep knowledge of Fusionâ€™s details.

### 2.1 Autonomous Capabilities of Domain Expert Entities

In addition to basic functionality, our domain expert entities are designed to operate with a high degree of autonomy, following these principles:

- **Contextual Understanding:** Each domain expert evaluates high-level requests to determine if additional context is needed and, if so, autonomously gathers the required information before initiating the task.

- **Structured Planning:** Experts decompose complex tasks into a series of subtasks, establishing a clear, structured plan. This mirrors how professional consultants break down projects into actionable steps.

- **Subprocess Spawning:** For multifaceted tasks, an expert can spawn subordinate processes or agents to handle individual subtasks independently, reducing the processing burden on the core system.

- **Iterative Execution and Refinement:** After executing each step, the expert evaluates the output, refines its plan if necessary, and iterates until the result meets predefined quality or relevance criteria.

- **Result Evaluation:** Rather than returning raw outputs, experts assess the quality and pertinence of their results. If a result does not meet domain-specific standards, the system will either iterate further or escalate the issue back to the core for additional guidance.

**Analogy to Professional Services:**

These capabilities can be likened to hiring specialized consultants. Just as organizations delegate complex projects to experts and trust them to manage the details autonomously, the Cortex Core leverages expert entities to handle domain-specific challenges without micromanaging every step. This trust-based delegation improves overall efficiency and system performance.

## 3. External Integration and Tools

In addition to domain experts, the Cortex platform integrates with various external tools and services, including:

- **VS Code Extension (MCP Server):** Provides direct integration with VS Code, enabling context-aware code assistance.
- **M365 Apps:** Connects to Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel for document and presentation management.
- **Browser Extension (Playwright):** Facilitates web automation and interaction with browser-based applications.
- **Other Tools:** Custom connectors, API plugins, and specialized integration modules that enhance the platform's capabilities.

These integrations leverage MCP to maintain a uniform communication channel, allowing the Cortex Core to treat all connected modules as interchangeable components.

## 4. Workspaces Concept

The concept of **Workspaces** is included as a near-term initiative to provide a higher-level organizational structure. Workspaces are designed to group artifacts, conversations, and context by project, topic, or collaborative group. Key features include:

- **Artifact Organization:** Consolidate files, notes, and contextual data within a defined workspace.
- **Contextual Integrity:** Maintain relevant synthesized context specific to a workspace, rather than storing raw, unprocessed history.
- **Collaboration:** Allow multiple users to collaborate within the same workspace environment, sharing insights from expert systems as needed.

Workspaces will integrate with the core functionality to enhance contextual management and adaptive outputs.

## 5. Implementation Roadmap

The following roadmap outlines our phased approach towards a comprehensive Cortex ecosystem that includes domain expert systems and workspace integration.

### 5.1 Immediate Actions (Phase 1: Foundation)

- **Domain Expert Integration:**

  - Connect initial domain experts (e.g., Code Assistant and Deep Research) to the Cortex Core via MCP.
  - Establish a standardized API interface for expert systems using the MCP Protocol.

- **Basic UI for Expert Interaction:**

  - Develop minimal interfaces (e.g., a VS Code extension and a web dashboard) to test expert system integrations.

- **Initial Workspaces Setup:**
  - Prototype a basic workspace framework to group context and artifacts.

### 5.2 Core Capabilities and Expansion (Phase 2: Core Capabilities)

- **Enhance Domain Expert Systems:**

  - Refine the intelligence and contextual capabilities of existing experts (Code Assistant and Deep Research).
  - Explore and integrate alternative or third-party expert systems, enabling hot-swapping of modules.

- **Refine MCP Integration:**

  - Strengthen the standardized communication between the Cortex Core and expert systems with robust error handling, logging, and dynamic discovery of MCP-enabled experts.

- **UI and Adaptive Output Enhancement:**
  - Further develop dashboard visualizations and integrate adaptive output strategies based on user modality (e.g., blending verbal and visual responses).

### 5.3 Long-Term Vision (Phase 3: Expansion & Refinement)

- **Advanced Workspaces:**

  - Develop enhanced workspace capabilities for detailed project management, multi-user collaboration, and contextual filtering of artifacts.

- **Expanded Ecosystem of Domain Experts:**

  - Open the platform for community-driven and third-party domain expert systems.
  - Develop a marketplace or selection mechanism for expert systems based on performance and user preference.

- **Distributed and Federated Deployment:**
  - Support hybrid deployment models (cloud, edge, and local) to scale Cortex across diverse environments.
  - Enhance overall security, permissions, and performance tracking for enterprise-level applications.

## 6. Technology Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) for core services and MCP integration.
- **MCP Integration:** Python MCP SDK for standardized communication.
- **Domain Expert Systems:** Implemented in Python or TypeScript, depending on the target integration (e.g., Code Assistant via a VS Code extension).
- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript and Vite, using Fluent Design for modern UI components.
- **Workspace Management:** Modular components integrated via REST APIs and MCP messaging.

## 7. Conclusion

This document outlines the strategic direction for integrating domain expert systems into the Cortex platform and presents a roadmap for future enhancements, including workspace integration. Leveraging MCP as the standard connectivity protocol ensures flexibility and interoperability, while the design of autonomous expert entities promotes a robust, efficient, and scalable ecosystem.

By providing default implementations that can be easily replaced or extended, Cortex aims to foster a vibrant community of domain experts and third-party integrations.
