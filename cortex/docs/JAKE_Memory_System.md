# Cortex JAKE Memory System

_Version: 1.0_  
_Date: March 5, 2025_

## Overview

The Just-About-Knowledge-Everything (JAKE) Memory System is the core memory architecture of the Cortex Platform, providing unified context preservation across all interactions. JAKE enables the platform to maintain coherent, consistent understanding of users, their history, and relevant knowledge, ensuring a truly unified intelligence experience regardless of interaction modality or entry point.

## Core Concepts

### Memory Model

The JAKE memory model is built on the following key concepts:

1. **Entities**: Discrete knowledge units with properties and relationships
2. **Relationships**: Connections between entities with type and directionality
3. **Context**: Active working memory for current interactions
4. **Knowledge**: Long-term structured information
5. **Memory Embeddings**: Vector representations of memories for similarity-based retrieval

### Memory Types

JAKE manages several types of memory:

1. **Episodic Memory**: Records of specific interactions and events
2. **Semantic Memory**: General knowledge and concepts
3. **Procedural Memory**: Task workflows and processes
4. **Working Memory**: Active content for current processing
5. **Meta-Memory**: Information about memory organization and access patterns
