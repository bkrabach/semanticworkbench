# Cortex Domain Experts Roadmap: Autonomous Systems & Expansion Strategy

_Version: Draft 0.1_

## 1. Overview

The Cortex platform leverages specialized domain expert systems to offload complex, domain-specific tasks from the central core. These expert entities—such as the Code Assistant, Deep Research, and Autodesk Fusion Expert—are designed to operate autonomously, delivering high-quality, refined outputs through a process of contextual understanding, iterative planning, and adaptive execution. This document outlines our strategy for integrating, expanding, and refining these domain experts while fostering an ecosystem that supports parallelized development and seamless interoperability via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## 2. Autonomous Capabilities of Domain Expert Entities

Our domain expert systems are engineered not just to execute commands but to work independently in a manner similar to high-level consultants. Their key autonomous capabilities include:

- **Contextual Understanding:**  
  Each expert evaluates high-level requests to determine if further context is required. When necessary, it autonomously gathers the requisite information before undertaking its task.

- **Structured Planning:**  
  Professionals break down complex projects into actionable steps; similarly, each expert decomposes a task into a series of subtasks, creating a clear, structured plan of execution.

- **Subprocess Spawning:**  
  For multifaceted challenges, an expert can spawn subordinate processes to handle individual subtasks concurrently, thereby reducing the load on the central system and increasing execution efficiency.

- **Iterative Execution and Refinement:**  
  After performing an initial action, the expert assesses its output, refines its approach if necessary, and repeats the process until the result meets predefined quality or relevance standards.

- **Result Evaluation:**  
  Rather than simply forwarding raw data, each expert evaluates the final output against domain-specific criteria. If the result does not meet expectations, the system iterates or escalates the issue back to the Cortex Core for further directives.

_Analogy:_  
Just like hiring a specialized consultant who independently manages a complex project—from initial analysis to final delivery—our domain expert entities allow the Cortex platform to delegate intricate tasks with confidence, ensuring that the overall system remains efficient and high-performing.

## 3. Integration and Connectivity

- **MCP-Centric Connectivity:**  
  All domain expert systems are seamlessly integrated into the Cortex ecosystem through MCP. The central AI Core embeds an MCP client, which provides standardized message framing and robust communications. This ensures that whether an expert system is provided by our team or a third-party contributor, it interacts reliably with the core.

- **Plug-and-Play Flexibility:**  
  Our design makes these domain experts fully hot-swappable, meaning that default implementations (like our Code Assistant or Deep Research modules) can be easily replaced with community-driven or proprietary solutions without disrupting the overall architecture.

- **Unified Ecosystem:**  
  By connecting both internal and external expert systems via MCP, Cortex creates a vibrant, interoperable ecosystem where innovative modules can be developed in parallel and quickly integrated into the platform.

## 4. Roadmap for Domain Expert Expansion

The evolution of the domain expert systems within Cortex is envisioned in three phases:

### Phase 1: Foundation

- **Expert Integration:**
  - Integrate initial domain experts (e.g., Code Assistant and Deep Research) into the Cortex Core via MCP.
  - Establish a standardized API for domain experts to communicate and exchange data.
- **Basic UI for Testing:**
  - Develop minimal interfaces (such as VS Code extensions and web dashboards) to validate and demo expert system outputs.
- **Prototype Workspaces:**
  - Initiate a basic workspace framework to group context, enabling localized testing of expert outputs within specific domains.

### Phase 2: Core Capabilities and Expansion

- **Enhance Expert Intelligence:**
  - Refine the autonomous capabilities of existing experts, improving their contextual understanding, planning, and iterative execution processes.
  - Begin exploring additional or alternative expert systems that can be integrated seamlessly.
- **Refine MCP Integration:**
  - Harden the communication protocols to support dynamic discovery, error handling, and logging for domain expert systems.
- **UI and Adaptive Output:**
  - Enhance the user interfaces to better present expert-generated insights, ensuring adaptive outputs across various modalities (e.g., desktop, mobile, gaming interfaces).

### Phase 3: Long-Term Vision

- **Advanced Workspaces Integration:**
  - Develop enhanced workspaces that offer sophisticated project management, multi-user collaboration, and contextual filtering of expert outputs.
- **Expanded Expert Ecosystem:**
  - Open the platform to third-party and community-driven domain experts. Establish a marketplace or selection mechanism based on performance and user preference.
- **Distributed and Federated Deployment:**
  - Implement hybrid deployment models (cloud, edge, local) for scalable and secure distribution of the Cortex platform across diverse environments.

## 5. Technology Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) for core services and MCP integration.
- **MCP Integration:** Python MCP SDK to standardize communications.
- **Expert Systems:** Implemented in Python or TypeScript (depending on the integration platform, e.g., VS Code extension for Code Assistant).
- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript and Vite using modern UI libraries (e.g., Fluent Design) for testbed interfaces.
- **Workspace Management:** REST APIs and MCP messaging to create a unified environment for context grouping and collaboration.
