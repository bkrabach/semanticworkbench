# Cortex Platform Implementation Status

## Progress Summary

We've completed the initial planning phase for the simplified Cortex implementation, including:

1. Comprehensive analysis of the existing Cortex architecture
2. Documentation of key patterns to preserve and anti-patterns to avoid
3. Design of a simplified architecture maintaining core patterns
4. Database schema and model definitions
5. Phased implementation plan with timeline
6. Implementation guides for key components (MCP, LiteLLM)
7. Core implementation philosophy document

## Key Documents

1. **Architectural Documents**:
   - `/planning/simplified_architecture_revised.md` - Simplified architecture blueprint preserving MCP, SSE, and I/O separation
   - `/planning/implementation_comparison_revised.md` - Comparison with original implementation
   - `/IMPLEMENTATION_PHILOSOPHY.md` - Core implementation philosophy and guidelines

2. **Implementation Planning**:
   - `/planning/implementation_analysis.md` - Analysis of patterns to preserve and avoid
   - `/planning/database_schema.md` - Database schema and model definitions
   - `/planning/implementation_plan_revised.md` - Phased implementation approach

3. **Component Guides**:
   - `/planning/mcp_implementation_guide.md` - Guide for simplified MCP implementation
   - `/planning/litellm_implementation_guide.md` - Guide for LiteLLM integration

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Preserve Core Patterns**:
   - MCP for service-to-service communication
   - SSE for real-time client updates
   - Separation of input/output channels
   - Domain-driven repository pattern

2. **Simplification Approach**:
   - Streamlined implementations of architectural patterns
   - Reduced abstraction layers throughout codebase
   - Minimal but sufficient error handling
   - Direct library integration with minimal wrappers

## Next Steps

### Immediate Implementation Tasks
1. Create database schema and repository layer
2. Implement basic API endpoints for conversations
3. Build simplified SSE connection manager
4. Develop streamlined MCP client implementation
5. Create basic service layer components

### Development Approach
1. Focus on vertical slices of functionality
2. Build minimal end-to-end flow first
3. Iterate with additional features
4. Maintain ruthless simplicity throughout

## Implementation Notes

- Follow the `IMPLEMENTATION_PHILOSOPHY.md` guide for all development decisions
- Use good/bad examples as reference for implementation style
- Focus on getting a working system quickly rather than perfection
- Validate core architectural decisions with real code early
- Maintain minimal implementations that can be extended later

This document serves as a snapshot of our current planning status and next steps for the Cortex Platform implementation.
