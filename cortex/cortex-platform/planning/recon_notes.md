# Cortex Platform Recon Notes

This document collects reconnaissance notes about the current Cortex implementation, architectural vision, and areas for potential simplification or improvement. These notes will inform the planning process for a simplified implementation.

## Vision and Architecture

- **Central AI Core with Adaptive Ecosystem**: The core vision involves a central orchestrator with specialized autonomous modules.
  - See: `/cortex-platform/ai-context/vision/Central AI Core with Adaptive Ecosystem.md`
  - The "core as router" concept is fundamental - it coordinates between inputs, outputs, and specialized services

- **Domain Expert Entities**: Specialized, autonomous modules with deep expertise in specific domains.
  - See: `/cortex-platform/ai-context/vision/Domain Expert Entities.md`
  - These are designed to handle complex tasks independently with minimal oversight
  - Plan-execute-review cycle is a key operational pattern for these entities

- **Modular Approach**: Strong emphasis on modularity and separation of concerns throughout.
  - See: `/cortex-platform/ai-context/cortex/Cortex_Platform-Technical_Architecture.md` sections 2.1-2.2
  - Components should be swappable and independently maintainable
  - Interface contracts between components are crucial

- **User Experience Focus**: The technical architecture is ultimately in service of a seamless user experience.
  - See: `/cortex-platform/ai-context/cortex/Cortex_Platform-A_Day_in_the_Life.md`
  - System should adapt to the user's preferred interaction methods
  - Context maintenance across different modalities is key

## Current Implementation

  - Some business logic exists in the API layer
  - Need to enforce clean separation between layers

- **Event Flow Complexity**: Multiple redundant pathways for message and event processing.
  - See: `/cortex-core/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` section on "Event System and Communication Flow"
  - Components use both direct calls and event system for the same functionalities
  - Complex callback patterns with global state
  - Need to simplify and standardize event flows

  - Current "Whiteboard" implementation lacks semantic search and advanced features
  - Plans for more sophisticated JAKE system with vector embeddings
  - Opportunity to implement a simpler, effective memory system first

- **SSE Implementation Complexity**: SSE handling had several issues that required redesign.
  - See: `/cortex-core/docs/SSE_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
  - Problems included connection instability, premature cleanup, and improper state management
  - Now using sse-starlette library instead of custom implementation
  - Potential for further improvements like Redis integration for multi-instance deployments

## Key Technical Requirements

- **Async First**: Architecture uses async Python throughout.
  - See: `/cortex-core-enhancement-plans.md` and various implementation files
  - AsyncIO for background tasks rather than threading
  - Proper resource lifecycle management with cleanup methods
  - Consistent use of async/await patterns

    - API Models (Pydantic): Handle HTTP request/response concerns
  - Repository pattern abstracts data access and translates between database and domain models
  - Service layer contains business logic and works exclusively with domain models
  - Clear separation of concerns with dependencies pointing inward toward domain entities

- **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic in service layer between API and repositories.
  - See: `/cortex-core/docs/adr/adr-005-service-layer-pattern.md` and `/cortex-core/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` section on "Service Layer Implementation"
  - Services orchestrate operations across multiple repositories
  - No direct database access in service layer

## Opportunities for Simplification

- **Direct Communication**: Replace complex event chains with direct service calls where appropriate.
  - See: `/cortex-core/docs/AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md` section on "Continuous Codebase Improvement" and `/cortex-core/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` section on "Simplification Principles"
  - Prefer direct service calls over complex event chains for core flows
  - Only use the event system when true decoupling is needed
  - Keep the path from request to response as short as possible

- **Simplified Domain Expert Interface**: Create a more straightforward protocol for domain expert registration and communication.
  - Current MCP approach adds complexity that may not be necessary initially
  - See: `/cortex-platform/ai-context/cortex/Cortex_Platform-Technical_Architecture.md` section 4.4
  - Consider local implementations of domain experts first before distributed approach

- **WebSockets Instead of SSE**: More widely supported, bidirectional communication.
  - See: `/cortex-core/docs/SSE.md` and `/cortex-core/docs/SSE_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
  - Would simplify client implementations and potentially reduce connection management complexity
  - Standard WebSocket implementations are more widely available and understood

- **Reduced Abstraction Layers**: Fewer interfaces and abstraction layers for core functionality.
  - See: `/cortex-core/docs/AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md` section on "Message Processing Flow" and `/cortex-core/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` section on "Complexity Evaluation"
  - Evaluate components on their core purpose and cognitive load
  - Can you easily diagram the component's interactions? If not, it's too complex
  - Focus on concrete implementations that work rather than extensive abstraction

- **Focused Memory System**: Start with a simpler, effective memory approach.
  - See: `/cortex-core-enhancement-plans.md` Task 4.2
  - Begin with direct database-backed memory before implementing vector storage
  - Focus on API consistency so implementation can be swapped later
