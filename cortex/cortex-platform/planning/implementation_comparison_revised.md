## Conclusion

Our simplified Cortex implementation maintains the key architectural patterns of the original design while significantly reducing implementation complexity. By focusing on streamlined implementations of MCP, SSE, and Input/Output separation, we've created a more maintainable system that preserves the architectural vision with less overhead.

The simplified implementation is not a rejection of the original architecture, but rather a more focused implementation of its core patterns. By carefully simplifying the implementations while keeping the interfaces intact, we create a system that is easier to develop, maintain, and extend without sacrificing architectural integrity.
