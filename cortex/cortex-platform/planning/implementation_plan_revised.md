## Technical Details

### Core Components
1. **API Layer**: FastAPI endpoints
2. **Input/Output Channels**: Separate input receivers and output publishers
3. **Service Layer**: Business logic orchestration
4. **Repository Layer**: Database abstraction
5. **SSE Manager**: Real-time communication
6. **Message Router**: Message processing and routing
7. **MCP Client**: Model Context Protocol client
8. **Event System**: Topic-based event distribution
9. **LLM Service**: AI model integration
10. **Memory System**: MCP-based context management

### Development Approach
- **Clear Interfaces First**: Define and document interfaces before implementation
- **Simplified Implementations**: Focus on readability and maintainability
- **Incremental Delivery**: Each component should be functional before moving on
- **Regular Refactoring**: Improve code organization as patterns emerge
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests for critical components

## Simplification Focus Areas

While maintaining the architectural patterns, we will simplify:

1. **MCP Client**: Reduce connection complexity and error handling overhead
2. **SSE Implementation**: Streamline connection management
3. **Event System**: Remove pattern matching in favor of direct topic subscriptions
4. **Router Implementation**: Simplify queue processing and routing logic
5. **Error Handling**: Create a consistent approach across components
6. **Type Safety**: Reduce unnecessary type wrappers and conversions

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Users can conduct natural conversations with AI assistants
2. Real-time updates work reliably through SSE
3. MCP-based communication functions properly between components
4. Input and output channels maintain proper separation
5. Domain experts can be easily integrated via MCP
6. The system maintains responsiveness under load
7. Code is well-documented and maintainable

## Next Steps

1. **Database Schema Implementation**: Create the actual database tables
2. **Project Setup**: Configure the development environment
3. **Repository Layer**: Implement the data access components
4. **Basic API Endpoints**: Create the core RESTful interface
