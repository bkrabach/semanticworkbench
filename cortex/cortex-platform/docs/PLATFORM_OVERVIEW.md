# Cortex Platform Overview

## Introduction

The Cortex Platform is an intelligent, modular AI ecosystem designed to transform digital interactions through a central orchestrating core that coordinates with specialized autonomous modules. It aims to provide a seamless, context-aware user experience across multiple modalities while maintaining a flexible, extensible architecture.

## Platform Vision

The Cortex Platform represents a new approach to AI systems that moves beyond isolated AI assistants to create an adaptive, unified ecosystem. Key aspects of this vision include:

- **Unified Intelligence Experience**: A system that understands user needs regardless of context, maintaining consistent awareness across tasks and modalities.
- **Modularity and Autonomy**: A central core that delegates complex tasks to specialized Domain Expert entities, similar to how a business might engage specialized consultants.
- **Adaptive User Experience**: Fluid transitions between different interaction modes (chat, voice, canvas, native apps) while maintaining full context.
- **Integration with Existing Tools**: Seamless connections to productivity tools like VSCode, Microsoft Office, and browsers rather than recreating these experiences.

## Architecture

The platform is built around a central organizing element—the Cortex Core—that orchestrates interactions between specialized modules and external integrations:

1. **Cortex Core**: The central "brain" responsible for:
   - Task orchestration and delegation
   - Unified context management via memory systems
   - Security and session management
   - Integration with external services

2. **Memory System**: Preserves and synthesizes contextual data across engagements, initially implemented as a simplified "whiteboard" model with plans to evolve to more sophisticated systems like JAKE.

3. **Cognition System**: Provides adaptive reasoning, intelligent planning, and dynamic decision-making to interpret user intent and optimize task execution.

4. **Domain Expert Entities**: Autonomous specialized modules that handle complex domain-specific tasks like coding assistance, deep research, and data analysis with minimal oversight from the core.

5. **Input/Output Modalities**: Supports diverse interaction modes:
   - **Input**: Chat, voice, canvas, native applications
   - **Output**: Chat, voice, canvas, dashboards, notifications

6. **Integration Layer**: Connects the platform to external services:
   - Uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) for standardized communication
   - Integrates with VSCode, Microsoft 365 apps, browser extensions
   - Supports various protocols (RESTful APIs, SSE, WebRTC)

## Current Implementation

The current Cortex Platform implementation consists of two main components:

### Cortex Core (Backend)

A FastAPI-based service that provides:
- Conversation and message management
- LLM integration for intelligent responses
- Tool execution framework
- Memory storage and retrieval
- Real-time updates via Server-Sent Events
- Authentication and security

### Cortex Chat (Frontend)

A React-based web application that offers:
- Conversation interface with message history
- Real-time message streaming
- Tool result visualization
- Markdown and code rendering
- Authentication and theme management

## Integration Strategy

The platform employs the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as its integration backbone, providing:
- Standardized connection framework for services
- Community collaboration opportunities
- Robust security and authentication
- Flexibility to evolve as new protocols emerge

## Future Direction

The Cortex Platform is designed to evolve through:
- Enhanced memory systems beyond the initial whiteboard model
- Additional Domain Expert entities for specialized tasks
- Expanded modality support
- Deeper integration with productivity tools
- Community-driven extensions and modules

By maintaining clear interface contracts between components, the platform enables continuous improvement while ensuring backward compatibility and stability.
