# Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Cortex Chat client, including current status, priorities, and future work.

## Current Status

The project has completed the initial scaffolding phase, which includes:

- Project structure and configuration
- Core services (API, Authentication, SSE)
- Basic state management
- Type definitions
- Foundation for UI with FluentUI

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Current)

- [x] Project setup and configuration
- [x] TypeScript and path aliases
- [x] Authentication service
- [x] HTTP client
- [x] SSE Manager implementation
- [x] Basic application layout
- [ ] Route structure and navigation
- [ ] Error handling utilities
- [ ] Logging system

### Phase 2: User Authentication & Basic UI (Next)

- [ ] Login screen with proper validation
- [ ] User profile management
- [ ] Session persistence
- [ ] Main application layout
- [ ] Navigation sidebar
- [ ] Theme implementation
- [ ] Basic settings screen
- [ ] Responsive design for mobile/desktop

### Phase 3: Workspace & Conversation Management

- [ ] Workspace selection and creation
- [ ] Workspace settings management
- [ ] Conversation list view
- [ ] Conversation creation
- [ ] Conversation search and filtering
- [ ] Conversation metadata display
- [ ] Conversation export/sharing

### Phase 4: Chat Functionality

- [ ] Message list component
- [ ] Message rendering with formatting
- [ ] Message input with keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Optimistic updates for sent messages
- [ ] Real-time message updates via SSE
- [ ] Typing indicators
- [ ] Message reactions/feedback
- [ ] Message search
- [ ] Code syntax highlighting

### Phase 5: Advanced Features

- [ ] Multi-modal inputs (voice recordings)
- [ ] Canvas/drawing input
- [ ] File attachments
- [ ] Rich content rendering
- [ ] Customizable UI
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Context-aware suggestions
- [ ] Notifications
- [ ] Offline support

### Phase 6: Performance & Production Readiness

- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Bundle size optimization
- [ ] Caching strategies
- [ ] Comprehensive testing
- [ ] Accessibility improvements
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Deployment strategy

## Technical Debt Management

As we implement features, we'll be vigilant about managing technical debt:

1. **Testing Debt**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage is maintained
2. **Documentation Debt**: Keep documentation in sync with implementation
3. **Type Safety**: Maintain strict TypeScript typing
4. **Code Quality**: Regularly refactor to maintain clean code
5. **Performance**: Monitor and optimize performance bottlenecks

## Key Technical Decisions

### SSE Implementation

We've implemented a robust SSE Manager based on our [ADR-001](./adr/adr-001-sse-implementation.md), which includes:

- Connection management
- Reconnection strategies
- Event routing
- Resource cleanup

### State Management

We've chosen a hybrid approach:

- React Context for global state (auth)
- React Query for data fetching
- Local component state for UI-specific concerns

### UI Framework

We're using FluentUI React Components with:

- Responsive design principles
- Accessibility built-in
- Theme support

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps are:

1. Complete the authentication UI with proper validation
2. Implement the main application layout
3. Create the workspace selection components
4. Implement the conversation list view
5. Add the message list and input components

## Future Considerations

As the project evolves, we'll need to address:

1. **Offline Support**: How to handle offline scenarios
2. **Scalability**: How to handle large numbers of conversations and messages
3. **Security**: Advanced security considerations
4. **Performance**: Optimizations for different devices and connection speeds
5. **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for custom extensions
