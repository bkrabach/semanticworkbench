# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines performance optimizations implemented in the Cortex Chat client to ensure a smooth user experience across devices and network conditions.

## Responsive Layout Optimizations

### Viewport Management

The application implements efficient viewport management through:

- Proper HTML and CSS reset to ensure consistent rendering across browsers
- Root element configuration to fill the entire viewport
- Responsive media queries for different screen sizes
- Overflow handling to prevent unnecessary scrollbars
- Use of CSS variables for consistent sizing

Implementation:

```css
/* Base document setup */
html, body, #root {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
}

/* Responsive container */
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

### Component-Level Optimizations

Components use the following optimizations:

- CSS `calc()` for dynamic sizing relative to viewport
- Flexbox and Grid for efficient layout rendering
- Conditional rendering based on screen size
- Mobile-first media queries
- Hardware-accelerated animations for smooth transitions

## React Performance Optimizations

### Component Lifecycle Management

- Proper use of `useCallback` and `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Memoization of event handlers to maintain stable references
- Careful dependency management in effect hooks
- Use of React.memo for pure components

### State Management

- Local component state for UI-specific concerns
- Minimized prop drilling using context where appropriate
- Optimistic UI updates for better perceived performance
- Batched state updates to reduce render cycles

## SSE (Server-Sent Events) Optimizations

### Connection Management

The SSE implementation includes several optimizations:

- Connection reuse to prevent establishing redundant connections
- Intelligent connection pooling based on channel type
- Proper cleanup of connections when components unmount
- Network status monitoring with automatic reconnection
- Tracking of connection state to prevent unnecessary reconnections

### Event Handling

Event handling is optimized through:

- Use of React refs to maintain stable references to handlers
- Prevention of duplicate event listeners
- Proper cleanup of event listeners when connections close
- Efficient event routing based on type
- Error boundaries for event processing

## Implementation Example

Here's an example of the SSE hook with performance optimizations:

```typescript
function useSSE(
    type: ChannelType,
    resourceId: string | undefined,
    eventHandlers: Record<string, EventHandler>,
    enabled: boolean = true
) {
    // Use refs to track current values without triggering effect reruns
    const handlerRef = useRef(eventHandlers);
    const resourceIdRef = useRef(resourceId);
    const enabledRef = useRef(enabled);
    const typeRef = useRef(type);
    
    // Keep refs updated without triggering effects
    useEffect(() => {
        handlerRef.current = eventHandlers;
        resourceIdRef.current = resourceId;
        enabledRef.current = enabled;
        typeRef.current = type;
    }, [eventHandlers, resourceId, enabled, type]);
    
    // Main connection effect with minimal dependencies
    useEffect(() => {
        // Skip reconnection if nothing important has changed
        if (!shouldConnect) {
            return;
        }
        
        const eventSource = connect();
        
        return () => {
            // Cleanup on unmount or when dependencies change
            sseManager.closeConnection(type);
        };
    }, [type, shouldConnect]); // Minimal dependency array
}
```

## Memory Management

### Preventing Memory Leaks

- Event listeners are properly removed when components unmount
- Timeouts and intervals are cleaned up
- References to DOM elements are removed when no longer needed
- Large objects are properly dereferenced

### Resource Cleanup

- Connections are explicitly closed when no longer needed
- Pending reconnection attempts are cancelled when components unmount
- Event handlers are properly cleaned up

## Network Optimization

### Reconnection Strategy

- Exponential backoff for failed connections
- Maximum reconnection attempts to prevent infinite retries
- Intelligent retry strategy based on error type
- Connection health monitoring

### Error Handling

- Graceful degradation when network errors occur
- Transparent reconnection without disrupting the user experience
- Clear error messaging when persistent connection issues occur

## CSS Optimization

### Efficient Styling

- CSS-in-JS with optimized style generation
- Minimal use of heavy selector patterns
- Avoidance of large CSS frameworks
- Proper use of CSS variables for theming
- Hardware-accelerated animations

## Best Practices

When implementing performance optimizations, consider:

1. **Measure First**: Always establish performance baselines before optimizing
2. **Focus on User Experience**: Prioritize optimizations that directly impact the user experience
3. **Test on Real Devices**: Ensure optimizations work across different devices and browsers
4. **Balance Complexity**: Don't over-optimize at the cost of code maintainability
5. **Document Optimizations**: Ensure others understand the purpose and implementation of optimizations

## Future Optimizations

Planned future optimizations include:

- Code splitting for more efficient loading
- Virtualization for long lists to improve performance
- Advanced caching strategies for API responses
- Worker threads for heavy computations
- Image and resource lazy loading
