# SSE Implementation Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to the Server-Sent Events (SSE) implementation in Cortex Core. The changes address critical issues identified in the previous implementation, including connection instability, premature connection cleanup, and improper state management.

## Key Issues Addressed

1. **Connection Instability**: Connections were registering but immediately disappearing from the connection registry
2. **Resource Management**: FastAPI's background tasks were prematurely cleaning up connections
3. **State Management**: Connection state wasn't properly preserved across async contexts
4. **Error Handling**: No robust reconnection strategy existed

## Implementation Changes

### 1. Adoption of sse-starlette Library

We've replaced our custom SSE implementation with the well-established `sse-starlette` library, which provides:

- Better connection stability with proper lifecycle management
- Improved client disconnect detection
- Robust error handling
- Simplified code maintenance

The library has been added as a dependency in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
dependencies = [
    # ... existing dependencies
    "sse-starlette>=1.6.5",
]
```

### 2. New SSE Connection Manager

A new connection manager (`SSEStarletteManager`) has been implemented that leverages `sse-starlette` while maintaining compatibility with our domain-driven architecture:

- Uses proper disconnect detection via the Request.is_disconnected() method
- Implements a callback-based event distribution system
- Maintains connection state using our domain models
- Provides the same interface as the previous implementation

### 3. SSE Service Layer Updates

The SSE service now:

- Uses the new `SSEStarletteManager` instead of the custom implementation
- Properly handles request objects for connection lifecycle detection
- Maintains the same API contract for backward compatibility
- Still follows the domain-driven repository pattern

### 4. API Layer Integration

The API endpoints have been updated to:

- Pass the actual FastAPI Request object to the SSE response
- Maintain the same endpoint structure and URL patterns
- Preserve all authentication and authorization logic

## Benefits

1. **Connection Stability**: Connections now remain active for the expected duration
2. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup only when clients actually disconnect
3. **State Management**: Connection state properly preserved
4. **Error Handling**: Better error handling and logging
5. **Maintainability**: Reduced custom code to maintain
6. **Scalability**: Better support for high connection loads

## Future Considerations

For even more robust SSE handling in production, consider these additional enhancements:

1. **Redis Integration**: Use Redis Pub/Sub to distribute events across multiple service instances
2. **Connection Limits**: Implement per-user connection limits
3. **Token Refresh**: Handle token expiry for long-lived connections
4. **Monitoring**: Add detailed connection monitoring and diagnostics
5. **Load Testing**: Conduct thorough load testing to verify behavior under high connection loads

## Client Integration

Client code should continue to work with no changes required. The SSE endpoints maintain the same URL structure and event format.

## Deployment Considerations

When deploying this improved implementation, consider these configuration recommendations:

1. **Nginx Configuration**:
   ```
   proxy_buffering off;
   proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
   ```

2. **Timeouts**: Adjust application server timeouts (e.g., uvicorn) to allow long-lived connections

3. **Horizontal Scaling**: Consider implementing Redis backend for connection state sharing
