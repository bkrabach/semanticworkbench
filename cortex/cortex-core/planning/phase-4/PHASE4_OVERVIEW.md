# Cortex Core Phase 4: Distributed Services

## Project Overview

Phase 4 transforms the in-process MCP architecture established in Phase 3 into a truly distributed system with standalone services communicating over the network. Building on the validated service patterns and interfaces, this phase moves services to independent processes, implements network-based communication, adds service discovery, and enhances error handling for distributed operations.

This phase focuses on extracting the Memory and Cognition services into standalone applications, updating the MCP client for network communication, implementing robust connection management, and creating a simple but effective service discovery mechanism. These changes enable independent scaling and deployment of services while maintaining compatibility with existing client applications.

## Goals of Phase 4

1. **Implement Standalone Services**: Extract Memory and Cognition services to independent processes
2. **Enable Network Communication**: Update MCP client for HTTP/SSE-based network communication
3. **Add Service Discovery**: Create simple but effective service registration and discovery
4. **Enhance Connection Management**: Implement robust connection handling and recovery
5. **Improve Error Handling**: Add distributed-specific error handling and recovery
6. **Enable Independent Scaling**: Allow services to be scaled independently
7. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing client applications continue to work

   ```

## Critical Implementation Details

### Network MCP Client

The network MCP client provides communication with distributed MCP services over HTTP and SSE.

Key details:

- HTTP for tool calls (request/response)
- SSE for resource streaming (continuous data)
- Connection pooling for efficiency
- Timeout management for unresponsive services
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Circuit breaking for service outages
- Error handling and logging

**Network MCP Client Implementation Example**:

```python
class NetworkMcpClient:
    def __init__(self, service_discovery):
        self.service_discovery = service_discovery
        self.connection_pool = {}
        self.circuit_breakers = {}

    async def connect(self, service_name: str) -> None:
        """Connect to a specific MCP service"""
        if service_name in self.connection_pool:
            return  # Already connected

        # Get service endpoint from discovery
        endpoint = await self.service_discovery.resolve(service_name)
        if not endpoint:
            raise ServiceNotFoundError(f"Service {service_name} not found")

        # Initialize connection pool for this service
        self.connection_pool[service_name] = await create_connection_pool(endpoint)

    async def call_tool(self, service_name: str, tool_name: str, arguments: dict) -> dict:
        """Call a tool on a specific MCP service"""
        await self.connect(service_name)

        # Check circuit breaker
        if self._is_circuit_open(service_name):
            raise CircuitOpenError(f"Circuit open for {service_name}")

        try:
            # Get connection from pool
            connection = await self._get_connection(service_name)

            # Make HTTP request to tool endpoint
            response = await connection.post(
                f"/tool/{tool_name}",
                json=arguments,
                timeout=10.0  # Configurable timeout
            )

            # Handle response
            if response.status_code == 200:
                return await response.json()
            else:
                # Handle error response
                self._handle_error(service_name, response)

        except Exception as e:
            # Handle exceptions and update circuit breaker
            self._record_failure(service_name)
            raise ServiceCallError(f"Error calling {service_name}.{tool_name}: {str(e)}")

    async def get_resource(self, service_name: str, resource_path: str) -> AsyncIterable:
        """Get a streaming resource from a specific MCP service"""
        await self.connect(service_name)

        # Check circuit breaker
        if self._is_circuit_open(service_name):
            raise CircuitOpenError(f"Circuit open for {service_name}")

        try:
            # Get connection from pool
            connection = await self._get_connection(service_name)

            # Create SSE connection to resource endpoint
            sse_client = await connection.stream(
                "GET",
                f"/resource/{resource_path}",
                timeout=30.0  # Longer timeout for SSE
            )

            # Stream data from SSE connection
            async for line in sse_client.aiter_lines():
                if line.startswith("data: "):
                    data = json.loads(line[6:])
                    yield data

        except Exception as e:
            # Handle exceptions and update circuit breaker
            self._record_failure(service_name)
            raise ResourceStreamError(f"Error streaming {service_name}/{resource_path}: {str(e)}")

    def _is_circuit_open(self, service_name: str) -> bool:
        """Check if circuit breaker is open for a service"""
        # Simplified circuit breaker implementation
        pass

    def _record_failure(self, service_name: str) -> None:
        """Record a service failure for circuit breaking"""
        # Simplified implementation
        pass

    async def _get_connection(self, service_name: str):
        """Get a connection from the pool for a service"""
        # Implementation for connection pooling
        pass
```

The service discovery mechanism provides a simple way to locate and connect to services.

Key details:

- Simple registry of service endpoints
- Environment-based configuration
- Basic health checking

- Direct lookup rather than complex resolution

**Service Discovery Implementation Example**:

```python
class ServiceDiscovery:
    def __init__(self):
        self.services = {}
        self.health_status = {}

    async def initialize(self):
        """Initialize service discovery from environment"""
        # Read service endpoints from environment variables
        self.services = {
            "memory": os.getenv("MEMORY_SERVICE_URL", "http://localhost:9000"),
            "cognition": os.getenv("COGNITION_SERVICE_URL", "http://localhost:9100")
        }

        # Initialize health status
        self.health_status = {service: None for service in self.services}

        # Start background health checking
        asyncio.create_task(self._health_check_loop())

    async def register(self, service_name: str, endpoint: str):
        """Register a service endpoint manually"""
        self.services[service_name] = endpoint
        self.health_status[service_name] = None

    async def resolve(self, service_name: str) -> Optional[str]:
        """Resolve a service name to an endpoint"""
        if service_name not in self.services:
            return None

        return self.services[service_name]

    async def is_healthy(self, service_name: str) -> bool:
        """Check if a service is healthy"""
        if service_name not in self.health_status:
            return False

        return self.health_status[service_name] == True

    async def _health_check_loop(self):
        """Background task for health checking"""
        while True:
            for service_name, endpoint in self.services.items():
                try:
                    # Simple health check via HTTP
                    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
                        response = await client.get(
                            f"{endpoint}/health",
                            timeout=5.0
                        )

                        self.health_status[service_name] = response.status_code == 200
                except Exception:
                    self.health_status[service_name] = False

            # Wait before next check
            await asyncio.sleep(30)  # Check every 30 seconds
```

            {
                "user_id": user_id,
                "input_data": data
            }
        )
```

### Containerization

Containerization enables simple deployment and scaling of distributed services.

Key details:

- Simple Docker containerization
- Environment-based configuration
- Minimal container size
- Health check configuration
- Clear service boundaries
- No complex orchestration requirements

**Example Dockerfile for Memory Service**:

```dockerfile
# Use Python 3.10 slim image
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Expose port for service
EXPOSE 9000

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:9000/health || exit 1

# Run the application
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "9000"]
```

### Error Handling in Distributed Environment

Distributed systems require more robust error handling to manage network failures and service unavailability.

Key details:

- Timeout configuration for network calls
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Circuit breaking for persistent issues
- Fallback strategies when services are unavailable
- Detailed error logging for diagnosis
- Consistent error response format

**Distributed Error Handling Examples**:

1. **Retry Logic**:

```python
async def call_with_retry(func, *args, max_retries=3, backoff_factor=1.5, **kwargs):
    """Call a function with retry logic"""
    retries = 0
    last_exception = None

    while retries < max_retries:
        try:
            return await func(*args, **kwargs)
        except (TimeoutError, ConnectionError) as e:
            retries += 1
            last_exception = e

            if retries >= max_retries:
                break

            # Exponential backoff
            wait_time = backoff_factor ** retries
            await asyncio.sleep(wait_time)

    # Max retries exceeded
    raise ServiceUnavailableError(f"Service call failed after {max_retries} retries") from last_exception
```

2. **Circuit Breaker**:

```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    """Simple circuit breaker implementation"""

    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, recovery_time=30):
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.recovery_time = recovery_time
        self.state = "CLOSED"
        self.last_failure_time = None

    def record_success(self):
        """Record a successful call"""
        if self.state == "HALF_OPEN":
            # Reset on success in half-open state
            self.failure_count = 0
            self.state = "CLOSED"

    def record_failure(self):
        """Record a failed call"""
        self.failure_count += 1
        self.last_failure_time = time.time()

        if self.state == "CLOSED" and self.failure_count >= self.failure_threshold:
            # Open the circuit
            self.state = "OPEN"

    def is_open(self):
        """Check if circuit is open"""
        if self.state == "OPEN":
            # Check if recovery time has elapsed
            if time.time() - self.last_failure_time >= self.recovery_time:
                # Move to half-open state
                self.state = "HALF_OPEN"
                return False
            return True

        return False
```

## Integration with Client Applications

Phase 4 maintains backward compatibility with client applications from previous phases, focusing on internal architecture changes that don't affect external interfaces.

### For External Clients

- No changes required for existing clients
- Same input, output, and configuration endpoints

## Validating Your Implementation

To ensure your Phase 4 implementation is correct:

1. **Distributed Service Testing**:

   - Start each service in a separate process
   - Verify network communication works
   - Test with services on different machines
   - Verify correct message passing between services
   - Test with multiple service instances

2. **Resilience Testing**:

   - Simulate network failures
   - Stop and restart services
   - Introduce network latency
   - Test with partial system availability
   - Verify recovery after failures

3. **Scalability Testing**:

   - Run multiple instances of each service
   - Test with increasing load
   - Verify independent scaling works
   - Check resource utilization under load
   - Verify connection pooling effectiveness

4. **Container Testing**:
   - Deploy services as containers
   - Test container orchestration
   - Verify health checks work
   - Test container restarts
   - Verify proper environment configuration

## Phase 4 in the Overall Project Timeline

Phase 4 builds on Phase 3 and prepares for Phase 5:

1. Phase 1: Functional Input/Output System with In-Memory Storage
2. Phase 2: Configuration API & Basic Persistence
3. Phase 3: MCP Protocol and Service Architecture
4. **Phase 4: Distributed Services** (current phase)
5. Phase 5: Production Hardening

## Developer Environment

Phase 4 requires the following additions to the Phase 3 environment:

- Docker and Docker Compose for containerization

At each step, verify that the implementation works as expected before moving on, focusing on complete functional paths with actual network communication.

## Conclusion

Phase 4 transforms the in-process MCP architecture from Phase 3 into a truly distributed system with standalone services. By implementing network-based communication, simple service discovery, and enhanced error handling, this phase enables independent scaling and deployment of services while maintaining the clean architecture and backward compatibility.

The focus remains on pragmatic implementation and minimal complexity, implementing just enough distributed system patterns to enable effective operation without overengineering. This approach allows for gradual enhancement in future phases while providing immediate benefits in terms of scalability and flexibility.

The subsequent documentation will provide detailed specifications for the network MCP client, service discovery mechanism, containerization approach, and distributed error handling strategies.
