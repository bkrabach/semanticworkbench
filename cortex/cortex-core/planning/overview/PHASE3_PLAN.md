## Ensuring Completeness and Clarity

To ensure these documents are sufficiently comprehensive:

1. **Complete Code Examples**: Include fully functional code examples for MCP clients, tools, and resources
2. **Service Interaction Diagrams**: Provide sequence diagrams showing communication between components
3. **Tool/Resource Catalogs**: Comprehensive listings of all tools and resources with their parameters
4. **Testing Examples**: Provide test cases that verify MCP service functionality
5. **Client Integration Examples**: Show how clients can leverage the new architecture
6. **Debugging Guides**: Include troubleshooting information for common issues

## Special Considerations

1. **In-Process Simplicity**: Keep the in-process implementation as simple as possible while establishing proper service boundaries
2. **Forward Compatibility**: Design the implementation to facilitate the move to distributed services in Phase 4
3. **Clean Service Boundaries**: Enforce strict service boundaries even within the same process
4. **Limited Scope**: Focus on essential tools and resources, avoiding unnecessary complexity
5. **Explicit Interface Definitions**: Define clear interfaces between components that will scale to distributed implementations
6. **End-to-End Functionality**: Prioritize complete workflows over comprehensive feature sets within each service
