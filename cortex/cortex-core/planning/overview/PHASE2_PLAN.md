# Phase 2 Documentation Plan for Cortex Core

A comprehensive set of documents tailored for Phase 2 implementation. This phase focuses on adding workspace/conversation management and basic persistence, building on the functional core established in Phase 1.

## Document Structure Overview

The following set of documents will provide everything a mid-level engineer needs to successfully implement Phase 2:

1. **PHASE2_OVERVIEW.md**: High-level architecture, goals, and scope boundaries
2. **PERSISTENCE_IMPLEMENTATION.md**: Step-by-step SQLite implementation guidelines
3. **CONFIG_API_SPECIFICATION.md**: Workspace and conversation endpoint specifications
4. **REPOSITORY_PATTERN.md**: Repository pattern implementation details
5. **DATA_MODELING.md**: Enhanced data models with persistence considerations
6. **VALIDATION_GUIDE.md**: Input validation approaches and best practices
7. **ERROR_HANDLING.md**: Consistent error handling for configuration endpoints
8. **TESTING_STRATEGY.md**: Testing approach for persistent storage
9. **MIGRATION_GUIDE.md**: Guide for migrating from in-memory to SQLite storage

## Document Content Planning

### 4. REPOSITORY_PATTERN.md

- Implementation of the repository pattern for data access
- Separation of concerns between database models and domain models
- Interface definitions for repositories
- SQLite-specific repository implementations
- Transaction management and error handling
- Testing repositories with in-memory SQLite

### 5. DATA_MODELING.md

### 8. TESTING_STRATEGY.md

- Testing approach for persistent storage
- Repository testing with SQLite in-memory databases
- Integration testing for the configuration API
- End-to-end testing for the core workflows
- Test data generation and fixtures
- Mocking external dependencies

### 9. MIGRATION_GUIDE.md

- Process for migrating from in-memory to SQLite storage
- Data model changes and their impact
- Testing migration paths
- Verifying data integrity post-migration
- Performance considerations and tuning
- Troubleshooting common issues

## Ensuring Completeness and Clarity

To ensure these documents are sufficiently comprehensive:

1. **Complete Code Examples**: Include fully functional code examples for all critical components including SQLite integration
2. **Database Diagrams**: Provide simple entity-relationship diagrams for the SQLite schema
3. **API Endpoint Examples**: Include curl commands and Python code examples for interacting with the configuration API
4. **Error Handling Examples**: Show common error scenarios and how to handle them
5. **Migration Test Cases**: Provide test cases that verify successful migration from Phase 1
6. **Cross-References**: Ensure concepts are fully defined and cross-referenced between documents

## Special Considerations

1. **Ruthless Simplicity**: Keep the SQLite schema as simple as possible, using TEXT/JSON fields where appropriate to avoid excessive normalization
2. **Minimal Migration Path**: Create a simple one-time migration from in-memory to SQLite without complex migration framework
3. **Direct Repository Implementation**: Implement repositories directly with minimal abstraction layers
4. **Schema Evolution Guidance**: Provide guidance on how to extend the schema in future phases
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with Phase 1 input/output flow while adding configuration capabilities
6. **Pragmatic Storage Approach**: Focus on practical storage needs rather than theoretical data model perfection
