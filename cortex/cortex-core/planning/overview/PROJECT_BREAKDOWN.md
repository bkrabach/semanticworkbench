# Phased Development Strategy for Cortex Platform

A development strategy that will allow your mid-level engineer to build the platform in incremental, functional phases while enabling others to start building connected systems early on.

## Key Principles for This Approach

1. **End-to-End First**: Build minimal but complete workflows before adding sophistication
2. **Interface Stability**: Define stable interfaces early to allow parallel development
3. **In-Process Before Distributed**: Start with simplified implementations before network distribution
4. **No Throwaway Work**: Each phase builds on the previous, with no major rewrites

## Recommended Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Functional Core with Memory-Only Implementation (2-3 weeks)

**Goal**: Create a working input/output flow that others can build against immediately

**Deliverables**:

- Basic FastAPI application with simplified JWT authentication
- In-memory implementation of the event bus
- Functional input endpoint (`/input`)
- SSE-based output endpoint (`/output/stream`)
- In-memory storage for messages

**What others can do**:

- Build input clients that POST to the input endpoint
- Build output clients that connect to the SSE stream
- Test basic end-to-end communication flows

**Implementation Strategy**:

1. Start with `app/main.py`, `app/api/input.py`, and `app/api/output.py`
2. Implement `app/core/event_bus.py` with in-memory queue
3. Add simplified JWT auth in `app/utils/auth.py`
4. Store everything in memory (no persistence yet)

This phase creates a minimal but functional message-passing system with proper auth that external developers can immediately integrate with.

### Phase 2: Configuration API & Basic Persistence (2 weeks)

**Goal**: Add workspace/conversation management and basic persistence

**Deliverables**:

- Configuration endpoints for workspaces and conversations
- Simple file-based persistence (SQLite)
- Basic error handling
- More complete authentication

**What others can do**:

- Build user interfaces for workspace/conversation management
- Test multi-user scenarios
- Persist and retrieve conversation history

**Implementation Strategy**:

1. Add `app/api/config.py` for workspace/conversation management
2. Implement SQLite storage for persistence
3. Enhance error handling across endpoints
4. Improve auth with token validation and user management

This phase enables persistent conversations and proper data organization, allowing for more realistic client implementations.

### Phase 3: MCP Protocol and Service Architecture (3 weeks)

**Goal**: Introduce the MCP architecture with in-process service implementations

**Deliverables**:

- MCP client implementation in the core
- In-process Memory Service implementation
- In-process Cognition Service implementation
- Service-based command routing

**What others can do**:

- Begin developing standalone MCP services
- Experiment with different service implementations
- Integrate with the evolving architecture

**Implementation Strategy**:

1. Implement `app/core/mcp_client.py` but with in-process "services"
2. Create service classes that follow MCP protocols internally
3. Route appropriate requests to each service
4. Maintain backward compatibility with Phase 1 & 2 APIs

This phase introduces the service architecture while keeping everything within a single process, establishing patterns that will be used in the distributed version.

### Phase 4: Distributed Services (2-3 weeks)

**Goal**: Move to truly distributed services with network communication

**Deliverables**:

- Standalone Memory Service implementation
- Standalone Cognition Service implementation
- Network-based MCP client in the core
- Service discovery and connection management

**What others can do**:

- Deploy and scale services independently
- Implement custom service variants
- Test distributed system behavior

**Implementation Strategy**:

1. Extract in-process services to standalone processes
2. Update MCP client for network communication
3. Add connection management and error handling
4. Implement service discovery (simple at first)

This phase moves from the in-process architecture to a truly distributed system, allowing independent scaling and development of services.

### Phase 5: Production Hardening (2-3 weeks)

**Goal**: Complete the production-ready implementation

**Deliverables**:

- Azure B2C integration
- PostgreSQL support for production storage
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Performance optimizations
- Complete documentation

**What others can do**:

- Deploy to production environments
- Integrate with enterprise authentication
- Implement full-scale applications

**Implementation Strategy**:

1. Add Azure B2C integration to authentication module
2. Implement PostgreSQL repositories
3. Enhance logging, monitoring, and error handling
4. Optimize performance for scale
5. Complete all documentation

This final phase prepares the system for production use with enterprise-grade features.

## Critical Path Considerations

1. **Input/Output First**: The I/O path enables immediate integration work
2. **Configuration Second**: Organization and persistence enable realistic apps
3. **Services Third**: The service architecture enables parallel innovation
4. **Distribution Fourth**: True distribution enables scaling and independence
5. **Production Last**: Enterprise features complete the production readiness

## Why This Approach Works

This phased approach offers several advantages:

1. **Early Value**: Developers can start building against the platform after just Phase 1
2. **Clear Progress**: Each phase delivers measurable, functional improvements
3. **Parallel Development**: Enables multiple teams to work simultaneously
4. **Risk Reduction**: Major architectural components are validated early
5. **Flexibility**: Allows exploration of different service implementations
6. **No Rewrites**: Each phase builds on the previous without throwing away work
