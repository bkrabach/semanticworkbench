# Cortex AI Platform Design Documentation

_Version: 1.0_  
_Date: March 5, 2025_

## Overview

The Cortex Platform is an advanced AI assistant ecosystem that provides a unified intelligence experience across multiple modalities, devices, and use cases. Unlike traditional siloed AI assistants, Cortex maintains context, memory, and reasoning capabilities across all interactions, creating a seamless user experience regardless of entry point or modality.

## Core Design Principles

The Cortex Platform is built on the following key design principles:

1. **Unified Intelligence**

   - Centralized orchestration across all contexts
   - Consistent reasoning and personality
   - Shared memory spanning all interactions

2. **Multi-Modal Interaction**

   - Support for diverse input modalities (text, voice, canvas)
   - Context-appropriate output modalities (text, voice, visual, dashboard)
   - Seamless transitions between modalities

3. **Domain Expertise**

   - Specialized capabilities through domain expert modules
   - Deep integration of expert knowledge
   - Coordinated multi-expert collaboration

4. **Extensible Integration**

   - Standardized MCP protocol for tool integration
   - Flexible plugin architecture
   - Ecosystem of first and third-party integrations

5. **Autonomous Reasoning**
   - Task decomposition and planning
   - Self-directed information gathering
   - Independent problem-solving capabilities

## Architectural Components

### Central AI Core

The Central AI Core is the orchestration engine of the Cortex Platform, responsible for:

- Coordinating interactions between all system components
- Maintaining unified memory and context
- Orchestrating tasks across multiple experts and tools
- Ensuring consistent reasoning and responses
- Managing the flow of information between components

The Core contains several subsystems:

- **Memory Management**: Handles context preservation and knowledge storage
- **Reasoning Engine**: Provides planning, cognition, and learning capabilities
- **Task System**: Manages task decomposition, orchestration, and execution
- **Integration Layer**: Connects with experts, modalities, and external tools
- **Quality System**: Ensures safety, quality, and performance

### Memory System (JAKE)

The JAKE (Just Another Knowledge Engine) memory system provides:

- Long-term memory storage and retrieval
- Context maintenance across sessions
- Memory synthesis and contextualization
- Entity relationship tracking

### Input Modalities

Cortex supports multiple input channels:

- **Chat**: Text-based interaction through messaging interfaces
- **Voice**: Speech recognition and natural language processing
- **Canvas**: Visual and drawing-based interaction

### Output Modalities

Responses can be delivered through:

- **Chat**: Text-based responses
- **Voice**: Synthesized speech output
- **Dashboard**: Information visualization and analytics
- **Canvas**: Visual and graphical output
- **Notification**: Alert-style communications

### Domain Experts

Specialized modules that provide deep capabilities in specific domains:

- **Code Assistant**: Software development expertise
- **Deep Research**: Information gathering and synthesis
- **Other experts**: Extensible to additional domains

### External Integrations

Connections to external systems and tools:

- **VS Code Extension (MCP Server)**: Integration with development environments
- **M365 Apps**: Integration with productivity tools (Word, PowerPoint, Excel)
- **Browser Extension (Playwright)**: Web-based interaction capabilities
- **Other Tools**: API plugins and custom connectors

### Cognition System

Provides reasoning capabilities including:

- Pattern recognition
- Logical inference
- Planning and strategy
- Learning and adaptation

## Interaction Flows

### Primary User Interaction Flow

1. User provides input through an input modality (chat, voice, or canvas)
2. Input is processed and routed to the Central AI Core
3. Core retrieves relevant context from the memory system
4. Core determines the appropriate response strategy
5. Tasks may be delegated to domain experts or external tools as needed
6. Results are synthesized into a coherent response
7. Response is delivered through appropriate output modality
8. Interaction is recorded in memory for future context

### Tool Integration Flow

1. Core identifies need for external tool execution
2. MCP framework identifies appropriate tool
3. Request is formatted and sent to tool
4. Tool processes the request and returns results
5. Results are incorporated into response
6. Tool usage is recorded in memory

## Technical Implementation

The Cortex Platform is implemented using:

- Modern microservices architecture
- Event-driven communication patterns
- Containerized deployment model
- REST APIs for external integration
- MCP Protocol for standardized tool integration

### MCP Protocol

The Memory, Cognition, and Perception (MCP) Protocol provides:

- Standardized tool definition format
- Consistent message structure
- Resource discovery mechanisms
- Error handling patterns
- Authentication and authorization

## Extensibility

The Cortex Platform is designed for extensibility at multiple levels:

### Domain Expert Extension

New domain experts can be added to provide specialized capabilities in additional domains following the standard domain expert interface.

### Modality Extension

Additional input and output modalities can be integrated by implementing the modality controller interfaces.

### Tool Integration

New tools and services can be connected through the MCP protocol, enabling the platform to leverage a wide ecosystem of capabilities.
