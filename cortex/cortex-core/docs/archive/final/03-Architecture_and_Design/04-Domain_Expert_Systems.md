_Version: 1.0_  
_Date: 2025-03-04_

## Introduction

This document details the Domain Expert Systems architecture within the Cortex Platform. Domain Experts are specialized, autonomous components that provide deep expertise in specific domains while remaining integrated with the platform's unified intelligence framework.

Unlike conventional AI assistants that attempt to handle all domains with a general-purpose approach, Cortex's Domain Expert architecture enables specialized capabilities that can match or exceed human expertise in specific domains. This approach combines the benefits of specialized tools with the coherence of a unified platform.

## Domain Expert Concept

### Definition and Purpose

A Domain Expert within Cortex is a specialized intelligent system that:

1. **Possesses deep domain knowledge** in a specific field or task area
2. **Operates with significant autonomy** to plan and execute complex tasks
3. **Maintains awareness of broader context** from the Cortex Core
4. **Integrates seamlessly** with the unified user experience
5. **Continuously improves** based on feedback and new information

Domain Experts enable Cortex to deliver exceptional performance in specialized areas while maintaining the context continuity and unified experience that define the platform.

### Key Principles

The Domain Expert architecture follows these core principles:

1. **Specialized Excellence**: Each expert focuses on mastery of a specific domain rather than general capability
2. **Autonomous Operation**: Experts can independently plan and execute complex tasks within their domain
3. **Unified Context**: All experts share and contribute to the unified memory and context
4. **Standardized Integration**: Consistent interfaces enable seamless core-expert communication
5. **Flexible Architecture**: Experts can implement domain-specific approaches while maintaining standard interfaces
6. **Continuous Evolution**: Experts evolve independently based on domain-specific feedback and requirements

## Domain Expert Architecture
