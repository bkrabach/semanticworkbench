   - Update based on latest platform developments

## Content Development Methodology

For each document, we will follow this process:

1. **Extract and consolidate** information from existing documents
2. **Analyze** for gaps or inconsistencies
3. **Expand** content where needed to ensure completeness
4. **Restructure** for clarity and logical flow
5. **Add visual elements** to enhance understanding
6. **Review** for accuracy, consistency, and readability

## File Naming Convention

All files will follow this naming convention:

```
[section-number]-[document-number]-[document_name].md
```

Example: `01-02-Cortex_Value_Proposition.md`

## Implementation Timeline

The implementation will proceed in order of the document hierarchy, starting with executive materials and proceeding through the more detailed technical documentation.

## Dependencies and Source Mapping

| New Document           | Primary Source Documents                                         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Executive Summary      | Cortex_Platform_Overview.md                                      |
| Value Proposition      | Cortex_Platform_Overview.md                                      |
| System Architecture    | Cortex_Core_Architecture.md, cortex-unified-architecture.md      |
| Domain Expert Systems  | Cortex_Domain_Experts_Roadmap.md                                 |
| Implementation Roadmap | cortex-unified-architecture.md, Cortex_Domain_Experts_Roadmap.md |
| MCP Integration Guide  | Cortex_Core_Architecture.md, cortex-unified-architecture.md      |

## Next Steps

1. Create the folder structure
2. Develop document templates
3. Begin content development with Executive Materials
4. Proceed through each section sequentially

After this implementation plan is approved, the next step is to begin implementation in an appropriate mode such as Documentation Writer.
