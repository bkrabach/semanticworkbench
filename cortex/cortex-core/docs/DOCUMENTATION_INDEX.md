## Documentation Conventions

To maintain consistency across all documentation:

1. Use ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES for Markdown filenames
2. Keep content focused and well-structured
3. Update related documents when making significant changes
4. Clearly identify whether a document describes:
   - Current implementation (what exists now)
   - Planned implementation (what will exist soon)
   - Vision/Architecture (what we aim to build over time)
5. Date all documents and maintain a change log for significant updates
