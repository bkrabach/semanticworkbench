# Cortex Platform: Project Vision

_Date: 2025-03-07_

## Introduction

This document outlines the vision and high-level architecture of the Cortex Platform. It serves as the foundation for understanding both our long-term goals and the current implementation status.

## Vision Overview

The Cortex Platform envisions a future where digital intelligence manifests as a unified, adaptive ecosystem. At its core, Cortex creates an intelligent partnership between technology and users—one that is seamless, context-aware, and naturally intuitive to interact with.

The platform combines:

1. **A Central Cortex Core** - Providing orchestration, unified memory, and task management
2. **Autonomous Domain Expert Entities** - Specialized, independent modules for expert-level tasks
3. **Adaptive I/O Modalities** - Flexible interfaces spanning chat, voice, canvas, and native applications
4. **Standardized Integration Protocols** - Using MCP client/server approach and other integration mechanisms

## Modularity and Design Philosophy

A cornerstone of the Cortex vision is the platform's modular design. Rather than building a monolithic AI, we've adopted a modular approach where:

- The central core delegates complex or specialized tasks to dedicated domain expert entities
- These entities operate as highly autonomous, expert-level modules that plan, execute, and refine tasks within their domain
- The Cortex Core acts as the central orchestrator, ensuring every action is informed by rich, contextual understanding
- Each component can be developed, upgraded, or replaced independently without disrupting the entire system

This approach enables both depth of functionality and flexibility across the platform.

## Key Components

### Cortex Core

The Cortex Core is the central intelligence layer that orchestrates the entire platform:

- **Task Orchestration**: Mediating and sequencing requests from various inputs
- **Unified Context Management**: Maintaining persistent context across sessions
- **Dynamic Decision-Making**: Adaptive reasoning and planning using the Cognition System
- **Routing and Delegation**: Central dispatching of tasks to appropriate components
- **Integration Management**: Providing standardized interfaces to external services

### Domain Expert Entities

Domain Expert Entities are autonomous, specialized modules that empower the platform to tackle domain-specific challenges:

- **Expert-Level Processing**: Handling tasks requiring deep subject matter expertise
- **Interactive Guidance**: Identifying scenarios where user input would enhance outcomes
- **Self-Evaluation**: Incorporating assessment routines to evaluate work quality
- **Autonomy and Planning**: Independently decomposing complex tasks into manageable steps

Examples include the Code Assistant for programming tasks and Deep Research for complex information analysis.

### Memory System (JAKE)

The Memory System provides robust persistence and retrieval of contextual information:

- **Context Preservation & Synthesis**: Capturing and updating the evolving user context
- **Standardized Access Interface**: Consistent API for dependent components
- **Flexibility & Evolvability**: Support for different implementations, from simple to sophisticated

### Input/Output Modalities

The platform supports diverse interaction methods:

- **Chat**: Text-based conversational interfaces
- **Voice**: Real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities
- **Canvas**: Graphical space for visual illustration and annotation
- **Dashboard**: Dynamic visualization of system data and indicators
- **Notification**: Targeted, concise updates and alerts
- **Apps Integration**: Deep connections with native productivity tools

## Integration Strategy

Cortex uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) client/server approach as its foundation for integration:

- **Standardized Connection Framework**: Uniform methods for connecting services
- **Community Collaboration**: Leveraging and contributing to the growing MCP ecosystem
- **Future-Proofing**: Supporting custom extensions and protocol evolution

## Implementation Approach

The implementation strategy follows a progressive enhancement approach:

1. Build the Core first with essential capabilities
2. Add specialized components incrementally
3. Refine and enhance over time while maintaining stability
4. Enable community contributions through well-defined interfaces

## Timeline and Roadmap

The development roadmap follows these major phases:

1. **Phase 1 (Current)**: Proof of Concept implementation of Cortex Core
   - Basic conversation capabilities
   - Simple memory system
   - Limited tool integration
   - Core API endpoints

2. **Phase 2**: Enhanced Memory and Tool Integration
