# Documentation Updates - 2025-03-07

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to the Cortex Core documentation to improve consistency, clarity, and alignment with the actual implementation.

## New Documents Added

1. **PROJECT_VISION.md**
   - Consolidated the long-term vision of the Cortex Platform
   - Based on the content from `cortex-platform/ai-context` directories
   - Clearly identifies this as the aspirational target architecture

2. **IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md**
   - Clarifies what's currently implemented versus planned for future
   - Provides transparent roadmap information
   - Helps readers understand the current state of the project

## Significant Changes to Existing Documents

1. **DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md**
   - Reorganized structure for better navigation
   - Added new documents to the index
   - Added documentation conventions section with guidelines for maintaining consistency

2. **ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md**
   - Added clarification about current implementation vs. vision
   - Updated component descriptions to match actual implementation
   - Added "Current Limitations" section to be transparent about gaps
   - Added change log to track documentation updates

3. **API_REFERENCE.md** and **CLIENT_API_REFERENCE.md**
   - Added date stamps for version tracking
   - Aligned SSE event descriptions to be consistent
   - Added clarification about relationship between the two documents
   - Fixed inconsistencies in API response formats

4. **CORE_POC_PLAN.md**
   - Updated status to clarify this is a reference document
   - Added note directing readers to IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md for current status

5. **DATABASE_SCHEMA.md**
   - Added clarification about implementation status
   - Added date stamp for version tracking

6. **CLIENT_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md** and **CLIENT_QUICKSTART.md**
   - Added date stamps for version tracking
   - Added notes about current implementation status
   - Added references to related documents

## Consistency Improvements

1. **Standardized Document Headers**
   - All documents now have a consistent header format
   - Date stamps added to track when documents were last updated
   - Clear notes about document purpose and relationship to other docs

2. **Standardized API Descriptions**
   - SSE events now consistently use the same names across all docs
   - Response formats now match between main API docs and client docs
   - Examples show consistent data structures

3. **Clear Division Between Implementation and Vision**
   - All docs now clearly indicate what's currently implemented
   - References to long-term vision are clearly marked as such
   - Roadmap information provided where appropriate

## Next Steps for Documentation Maintenance

1. Keep all documentation updated as implementation progresses
2. Date-stamp all future updates
3. Maintain the separation between current implementation and vision
4. Update IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md as features are completed
5. Consider adding diagrams to illustrate the current architecture

These changes should significantly improve understanding of the project's current state and future direction, while reducing confusion between what's implemented versus what's planned.
