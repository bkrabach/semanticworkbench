# Phase 1 Documentation Plan for Cortex Core

A comprehensive set of documents specifically tailored for Phase 1 implementation. The goal is to provide a mid-level engineer with everything they need to be successful without additional context.

## Document Structure Overview

I plan to create the following set of documents:

1. **PHASE1_OVERVIEW.md**: High-level architecture, goals, and scope boundaries
2. **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md**: Step-by-step implementation instructions
3. **EVENT_BUS_SPECIFICATION.md**: Detailed specifications for the event bus component
4. **AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION.md**: JWT authentication implementation details
5. **API_ENDPOINTS.md**: Input/output endpoint specifications
6. **DATA_MODELS.md**: In-memory data models and storage approach
7. **TESTING_STRATEGY.md**: Testing approach with examples
8. **CLIENT_INTEGRATION.md**: Guide for client developers
9. **PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md**: File/folder organization and responsibilities

## Document Content Planning

### 1. PHASE1_OVERVIEW.md

- Clear definition of Phase 1 goals: enabling basic input/output flow
- Architecture diagram showing components and their relationships
- System boundaries and what is explicitly excluded
- Success criteria for Phase 1 completion
- Key principles: simplicity, end-to-end workflow, in-memory first

### 2. IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md

- Detailed step-by-step implementation instructions
- Development environment setup (Python 3.10+, FastAPI, etc.)
- Implementation sequence with checkpoints
- Configuration approach using environment variables
- Critical implementation notes and potential pitfalls

### 3. EVENT_BUS_SPECIFICATION.md

- Complete interface definition with method signatures
- Event payload schema with required fields
- Subscription and publishing mechanics
- Implementation details for the in-memory approach
- Thread safety and error handling considerations

### 4. AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION.md

- JWT token structure and claims
- Token generation and validation logic
- Dependency injection with FastAPI
- Secret key management
- User context extraction from tokens
- Simplified approach for Phase 1 (no Azure B2C yet)

### 5. API_ENDPOINTS.md

- Input endpoint (`/input`) complete specification
  - Request/response formats with examples
  - Authentication requirements
  - Error handling
- Output endpoint (`/output/stream`) complete specification
  - SSE implementation details
  - Event formatting and streaming
  - Connection management and cleanup
  - User-based event filtering

### 6. DATA_MODELS.md

- Base model with metadata field
- User model specification
- Message model specification
- In-memory storage implementation
- Data partitioning by user ID
- Consideration for future persistence

### 7. TESTING_STRATEGY.md

- Unit testing approach for each component
- Integration testing for the API endpoints
- End-to-end testing for the input/output flow
- Test data generation
- Running and verifying tests

### 8. CLIENT_INTEGRATION.md

- Authentication process for clients
- Sending input to the API
- Receiving output via SSE
- Error handling and reconnection strategies
- Example code in Python and JavaScript

### 9. PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md

- Complete file/folder structure for Phase 1
- Module responsibilities and relationships
- Import patterns and dependencies
- Configuration files and environment variables
- README template

## Ensuring Completeness and Clarity

To ensure these documents are sufficiently comprehensive:

1. **Complete Code Examples**: Include fully functional code examples for all critical components
2. **Error Cases**: Detail all common errors and their handling
3. **Validation Checkpoints**: Provide clear ways to validate implementation at each stage
4. **Forward Compatibility**: Note considerations for future phases without overcomplicating Phase 1
5. **Visual Aids**: Include diagrams for architecture, data flow, and component interactions
6. **Cross-References**: Ensure concepts are fully defined and cross-referenced between documents

## Special Considerations

1. **Simplified Authentication**: Clear guidance on implementing a simplified JWT approach that can be extended later
2. **In-Memory Storage**: Detailed explanation of the in-memory storage pattern that doesn't create throwaway work
3. **SSE Implementation**: Comprehensive coverage of Server-Sent Events implementation, as this is often challenging
4. **Clear Boundaries**: Explicit marking of what's included/excluded in Phase 1
5. **Test-Driven Approach**: Examples of tests that can be written before implementation
