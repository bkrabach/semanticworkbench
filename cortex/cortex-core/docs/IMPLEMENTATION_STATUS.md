# Cortex Core: Implementation Status

_Date: 2025-03-07_

## Overview

This document provides a clear picture of the current implementation status of the Cortex Core project, highlighting what's currently available versus what's planned for future development.

## Current Implementation Status

The current implementation of Cortex Core represents a functional proof-of-concept (PoC) that implements the foundational elements of the platform vision:

### Implemented Components

1. **Message Router**
   - Central event bus for component communication
   - Publisher-subscriber pattern for event distribution
   - Basic routing of messages between components

2. **Conversation Handler**
   - User message processing with LLM integration
   - Basic conversation history management
   - Tool execution coordination
   - Simple memory integration for conversation context

3. **LLM Client**
   - Integration with LLM providers via LiteLLM
   - Support for gpt-4o and other models
   - Function calling for tool usage
   - Streaming response handling

4. **Memory Adapter**
   - Simple "whiteboard" memory model
   - Basic context persistence and retrieval
   - User-specific memory partitioning
   - Designed with abstraction for future enhancements

5. **MCP Client**
   - Mock tool definitions and execution
   - Tool registration and discovery
   - Tool result handling
   - Basic execution lifecycle management

6. **Auth System**
   - JWT-based token authentication
   - Session management with expiration
   - Support for multiple auth methods (focus on AAD)
   - Basic user identity management

7. **SSE Manager**
   - Real-time connection management
   - Event broadcasting to clients
   - Connection tracking and cleanup

8. **API Endpoints**
   - Session validation
   - Conversation management (CRUD)
   - Message creation and retrieval
   - SSE endpoints for real-time updates

### Database Schema Implementation

The database implementation includes these key entities:

- **User**: Core user entity
- **LoginAccount**: Authentication credential storage
- **Session**: User session tracking
- **Conversation**: Container for messages
- **Message**: Individual messages with roles
- **MemoryEntry**: Simple memory storage
- **MCPServer/MCPTool/MCPToolParameter**: Tool definitions
- **ToolExecution**: Tool execution records
- **SSEConnection**: Real-time connection management

## Planned Future Development

The following components are planned for future implementation but are not currently available:

### Short-Term Roadmap

1. **Enhanced Memory System**
   - More sophisticated memory model beyond the whiteboard approach
   - Better contextual retrieval mechanisms
   - Improved integration with external memory systems

2. **Improved Tool Integration**
   - Full MCP protocol implementation
   - Support for more complex tool interactions
   - Better error handling and recovery

3. **Advanced Authentication**
   - Complete implementation of all authentication methods
   - Enhanced security features
   - More robust user management

### Medium-Term Roadmap

1. **Domain Expert Entities**
   - Implementation of autonomous expert modules
   - Support for specialized task handling
   - Integration with the core routing system

2. **Cognition System**
   - Advanced reasoning capabilities
   - Task planning and decomposition
   - Dynamic decision-making

3. **Additional Modalities**
   - Support for voice interactions
   - Canvas/visual interaction capabilities
   - Deeper native app integrations

### Long-Term Vision

1. **Fully Adaptive Ecosystem**
   - Complete implementation of the modular architecture
   - Rich ecosystem of domain experts
   - Sophisticated memory and cognition systems

2. **Community Extensions**
   - Support for third-party components
   - Extension marketplace
   - Developer tools for building on the platform

## Implementation vs. Vision

It's important to note the distinction between the current implementation and the long-term vision:

- **Current Implementation**: A functional proof-of-concept with basic capabilities
- **Vision Documents**: Describe the ultimate goal of a sophisticated, modular AI ecosystem

The documentation in this repository aims to clearly differentiate between:
1. What is currently implemented and available
2. What is planned for near-term development
3. What represents the long-term architectural vision

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps in development include:

1. Enhancing the memory system to support more sophisticated context management
2. Improving the MCP client implementation for better tool integration
3. Adding more comprehensive authentication options
4. Expanding API capabilities for better client integration
