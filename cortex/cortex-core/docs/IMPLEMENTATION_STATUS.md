## Implementation Details

### Cortex Core

The central engine of the platform is implemented with these key systems:

- **Session Management**: User authentication and session handling through JWT
- **Routing**: CortexRouter for message processing and LLM integration
- **Event System**: Publish/subscribe for inter-component communication
- **SSE**: Real-time client communication
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy with clean repository pattern

### Memory System

Currently implemented as the "Whiteboard" pattern described in architecture documents:

- **Whiteboard Storage**: Database-backed memory implementation
- **Domain Models**: Strong typing for memory items
- **Query Interface**: Structured query framework for memory retrieval

### Domain Expert Integration

Framework is in place, but actual domain experts are not yet implemented:

- **Integration Hub**: Service for connecting to domain experts
- **MCP Client**: Client for Model Context Protocol communication
- **Circuit Breaker**: Fault tolerance for domain expert calls

### LLM Integration

Support for multiple LLM providers through LiteLLM:

- **Multiple Providers**: OpenAI, Anthropic, and others
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time token streaming
- **Mock Mode**: Development without API keys

## Architectural Vision Alignment

The current implementation follows these key architectural principles from the vision:

1. **Modularity**: Clean separation of components with well-defined interfaces
2. **Domain-Driven Design**: Strong domain models and repository pattern
3. **Event-Driven Communication**: Loose coupling through publish/subscribe
4. **Clean Architecture**: Dependencies pointing inward toward domain entities

## Next Steps

1. Implement advanced memory system (JAKE or equivalent)
2. Create first domain expert implementation
3. Enhance context synthesis capabilities
4. Add tool calling for LLM interactions
5. Begin implementing additional modalities (voice, canvas)

These steps will continue to bring the implementation closer to the full vision outlined in the architecture documents.
