## Legacy Code Cleanup Tasks

The following code needs to be cleaned up to maintain a simpler, more focused codebase:

### LLM Adapter (Phase 1)
- [x] Refactor to consistently use Pydantic AI abstraction layer
- [x] Improve configuration system for provider selection
- [x] Clean up provider-specific implementation blocks
- [x] Simplify error handling and response formatting
- [x] Add validation for required environment variables

### Tools Implementation (Phase 2)
- [x] Remove fallback code in get_context
- [x] Remove fallback code in analyze_conversation
- [x] Remove fallback code in search_history
- [x] Remove MCP availability checks
- [x] Simplify import handling for get_client

### Mock LLM (Phase 3)
- [ ] Move to tests/mocks/ directory
- [ ] Simplify implementation for test scenarios only
- [ ] Update test imports and references
- [ ] Remove development-focused features

### Response Handler (Phase 4)
- [x] Optimize _execute_tool method
- [x] Simplify streaming implementation
- [x] Reduce redundancy in tool execution handling
- [x] Improve message delivery consistency

### Development Code (Phase 5)
- [ ] Move ensure_test_users_exist to development module
- [ ] Create clear separation between production/development code
- [ ] Implement environment-specific configuration
