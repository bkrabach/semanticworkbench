# Sampling Handler Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

We've refactored the assistant code to pull the sampling handler logic into dedicated files and make it more modular and flexible, particularly for supporting model selection:

1. **Created New Modules**:

   - `model_selection.py`: Handles model selection with a ModelSelector class that manages available models and their properties
   - `sampling.py`: Contains the SamplingManager class that centralizes sampling configuration and setup

2. **Updated Existing Code**:

   - `step_handler.py`: Added optional sampling_manager parameter and updated how it gets completions
   - `response.py`: Now uses the model selector and sampling manager to handle model preferences

3. **Added New Features**:
   - Dynamic model selection from user prompts using prefixes:
     - `reason:` - Use reasoning model
     - `use:model-name` or `model:model-name` - Use a specific model
   - Model type detection based on name patterns
   - Structured model registry with metadata like reasoning capabilities, token limits, etc.

## Key Benefits

1. **Improved Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns between model selection, sampling configuration, and request handling
2. **Better Extensibility**: Now easier to add support for new models or customize model selection logic
3. **Enhanced User Control**: Users can now specify their preferred model directly in their prompts
4. **Centralized Configuration**: Model properties are managed in a central registry, making updates easier

## Example Usage

Users can now use models in different ways:

```
reason: Why is the sky blue?
```

Will use the configured reasoning model (o3-mini by default)

```
use:gpt-4o What's the capital of France?
```

Will use the gpt-4o model

```
model:o3-preview Write a short story about robots
```

Will use the o3-preview model

## Next Steps

1. Add support for more model types as needed
2. Enhance the model selection logic with more sophisticated criteria
3. Add support for customizing temperature and other parameters in prompts
4. Consider adding a UI for selecting models
